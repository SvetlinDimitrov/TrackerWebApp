## Technologies Used

- Front-End: React
  - Visualization Library: D3.js
- Back-End: Java
  - Architecture: Microservices
  - Build Tool: Maven
  - Framework: Spring Boot
  - Cloud Framework: Spring Cloud
- Documentation: Swagger

## API Reference

The API is fully documented with Postman and Swagger:

- [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26519722/2s9Ykhh4Qv): This collection includes all the API endpoints with example requests and responses. You can import this collection into Postman to explore and test the API.

- Swagger Documentation: The API also includes Swagger documentation, which provides an interactive interface for exploring the API. You can access the Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html` endpoint when you run the application.

## Installation

The application is containerized using Docker and can be easily set up with Docker Compose. Follow these steps to get it running:

1. Navigate to the `microservice/docker` directory in the project repository.
2. Run the `docker-compose` file. This will automatically download the necessary Docker images from the project's Docker repository and start the application.

Please ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine before proceeding.

**Note:** When you first start the application, it may take a while for the Eureka server and gateway to fetch all the servers. During this time, you may see an error message in the console, and the server may return a 503 error. This is normal and should resolve itself within about a minute. If you see a loading screen, just refresh it a few times until the application loads.

## Usage

### REST API

Detailed instructions for using the REST API are provided in the Postman documentation. You can find examples of requests, responses, and other useful information there.
