    description: "Thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is a water-soluble B vitamin crucial for energy metabolism and cell function. It is naturally found in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Thiamin plays a vital role in the growth, development, and function of cells.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Metabolism": "Thiamin plays a critical role in energy metabolism by acting as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Its active form, thiamin diphosphate (TDP), participates in key reactions in glucose metabolism, helping convert carbohydrates into energy.",
        "Cell Growth and Function": "Thiamin is essential for the growth, development, and proper functioning of cells throughout the body. It supports cellular processes by facilitating the conversion of nutrients into usable energy, which is vital for cellular activities and overall health.",
        "Neurological Function": "Thiamin is crucial for maintaining healthy nerve cells and proper nervous system function. It plays a role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and supports the transmission of nerve impulses, contributing to optimal cognitive function and overall neurological health.",
        "Heart Function": "Thiamin is involved in the metabolism of fats and amino acids, which are essential for heart health. Adequate thiamin levels support the proper functioning of the heart muscle and help maintain cardiovascular health.",
        "Antioxidant Activity": "Thiamin exhibits antioxidant properties, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. By scavenging free radicals, thiamin helps protect cells from oxidative damage and supports overall health and aging processes.",
        "Digestive System Support": "Thiamin contributes to the proper functioning of the digestive system by assisting in the metabolism of carbohydrates and other nutrients. It aids in the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which is necessary for the digestion and absorption of food."
    },
    sources: {
        "Food Sources": "Thiamin-rich foods include whole grains, meat, and fish. In many countries, breads, cereals, and infant formulas are fortified with thiamin. Cereals and bread are primary sources of thiamin in the U.S. diet, while pork is another major contributor. However, dairy products and most fruits contain little thiamin. Processing and cooking methods can reduce thiamin content in foods, such as pasteurization decreasing thiamin in milk and heating reducing thiamin content in bread. Enriched foods generally have higher thiamin levels compared to unenriched ones.",
        "Bioavailability": "Limited data exists on the bioavailability of thiamin from food, but studies suggest that thiamin absorption increases when intake is low.",
        "Thiamin Content in Selected Foods": "Breakfast cereals fortified with thiamin provide 100% of the Daily Value (DV). Other sources include egg noodles, pork chops, trout, black beans, English muffins, mussels, tuna, whole wheat macaroni, acorn squash, and others, with varying levels of thiamin content per serving.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Thiamin is available in many dietary supplements, often in the form of thiamin mononitrate or thiamin hydrochloride. Multivitamin/mineral supplements typically provide about 1.5 mg of thiamin per serving. Benfotiamine, a synthetic thiamin derivative, is also used in some supplements and is converted to thiamin in the body."
    },
    dailyIntake: "Thiamin is naturally found in many foods and is also added to fortified foods. Good sources of thiamin include whole grains, fortified bread, cereal, pasta, and rice, as well as meat (especially pork) and fish, and legumes like black beans and soybeans. Seeds and nuts also contribute to thiamin intake.",
    deficiency: "Thiamin deficiency can lead to various symptoms and health issues, including weight and appetite loss, neurological symptoms like confusion and memory loss, heart problems, and specific syndromes such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, particularly prevalent among individuals with alcoholism.",
