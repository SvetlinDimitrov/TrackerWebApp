    description: "Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin naturally found in certain foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Unlike most animals, humans cannot produce vitamin C internally, making it an essential part of the diet.",
    functions: {
        "Collagen Biosynthesis": "Vital for the production of collagen, a key protein in connective tissue crucial for wound healing.",
        "Antioxidant Activity": "Acts as an important physiological antioxidant, helping to counteract the damaging effects of free radicals and regenerate other antioxidants like vitamin E.",
        "Immune Function": "Plays a significant role in immune function, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms.",
        "Iron Absorption": "Enhances the absorption of nonheme iron from plant-based foods, aiding in the body's iron metabolism.",
        "Prevention of Scurvy": "Inadequate intake leads to scurvy, characterized by fatigue, weakened connective tissue, and fragile capillaries, underscoring its essential role in maintaining overall health."

    sources: {
        "Food":"Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamin C, with citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe being major contributors to the American diet. While vitamin C isn't naturally present in grains, it's added to some fortified breakfast cereals. The vitamin C content in food may decrease with prolonged storage and cooking due to its water-soluble nature and heat sensitivity. Steaming or microwaving can help minimize losses.",
        "Dietary supplements":"Vitamin C supplements typically contain ascorbic acid, which has similar bioavailability to naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods. Other forms include sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, and combination products like Ester-C. Studies suggest that different forms of vitamin C supplements may have similar bioavailability, with ascorbic acid being the preferred and cost-effective option according to some research."

    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin C varies according to age and life stage. For infants from birth to 6 months, it's 40 mg. For infants aged 7–12 months, it's 50 mg. Children aged 1–3 years should aim for 15 mg daily, while those aged 4–8 years need 25 mg. Children aged 9–13 years require 45 mg daily. Teens aged 14–18 years should get 75 mg if they're boys and 65 mg if they're girls. For adults, men need 90 mg per day, and women need 75 mg. Pregnant teens should aim for 80 mg, while pregnant women need 85 mg. Breastfeeding teens should aim for 115 mg, and breastfeeding women need 120 mg. If you smoke, add 35 mg to your daily recommended amount.",
    deficiency: "Prolonged inadequate intake (below about 10 mg per day) can lead to scurvy. Scurvy manifests as fatigue, inflamed gums, skin spots, joint pain, slow wound healing, and unusual hair growth. Other symptoms include depression, bleeding gums, tooth loss, and anemia. If left untreated, scurvy can be fatal.",
