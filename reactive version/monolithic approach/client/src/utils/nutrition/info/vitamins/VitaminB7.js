    description: "Biotin, a B-vitamin present in numerous foods, plays a crucial role in energy metabolism. It aids in converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from the diet into the essential energy required by the body.",
    functions: {
        "Metabolism Regulation": "Biotin, a vital B vitamin, serves as a cofactor for five essential carboxylases involved in key metabolic pathways, including fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids. These carboxylases catalyze critical steps in metabolism, ensuring the efficient utilization of these nutrients for energy production and various cellular processes.",
        "Histone Modification and Gene Regulation": "In addition to its metabolic roles, biotin plays pivotal roles in histone modifications and gene regulation. By modifying the activity of transcription factors, biotin influences gene expression, thereby regulating various cellular functions and processes.",
        "Cell Signaling": "Biotin contributes to cell signaling processes, facilitating communication between cells and coordinating cellular activities. Through its involvement in cell signaling pathways, biotin plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to internal and external stimuli."
    },
    sources: {
        "Food": "Biotin-rich foods encompass a variety of sources such as organ meats, eggs, fish, meat, seeds, nuts, and select vegetables like sweet potatoes. The biotin content in food can fluctuate based on factors like plant variety, seasonal variations, and processing techniques. Notably, avidin in raw egg whites can hinder biotin absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, but cooking neutralizes this effect.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Selected foods with notable biotin content per serving include beef liver, eggs, salmon, pork chops, hamburger patties, sunflower seeds, sweet potatoes, almonds, tuna, spinach, broccoli, cheddar cheese, milk, yogurt, oatmeal, bananas, whole wheat bread, and apples.",
        "Dietary supplements": "Biotin supplements are available in various forms, including standalone biotin supplements, combinations with other B-complex vitamins, and multivitamin/mineral formulations. Oral absorption of free biotin from supplements is highly efficient, even at high doses up to 20 mg/day."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of biotin varies depending on age and life stage. Infants require 5-6 micrograms, children aged 1-8 need 8-12 micrograms, while teenagers and adults should aim for 25-30 micrograms. Pregnant and breastfeeding teens and women have slightly higher requirements at 30-35 micrograms.",
    deficiency: "Can lead to various health issues. These may include thinning hair, hair loss, a rash around facial and anal areas, pinkeye, elevated acid levels in the blood and urine, seizures, skin infections, brittle nails, and nervous system disorders. In infants, symptoms may manifest as weak muscle tone, sluggishness, and delayed development.",
