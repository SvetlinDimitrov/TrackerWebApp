    description: "Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient found in various foods. It plays a vital role in over 100 enzyme reactions related to metabolism in the body. Additionally, it contributes to brain development during pregnancy and infancy, as well as supporting immune function.",
    functions: {
        "Protein Metabolism": "Vitamin B6 in its coenzyme forms (PLP and PMP) is crucial for over 100 enzyme reactions, primarily involved in protein metabolism.",
        "Amino Acid Metabolism": "PLP and PMP play essential roles in amino acid metabolism, contributing to the breakdown and synthesis of amino acids.",
        "Metabolism of One-Carbon Units": "PLP is involved in the metabolism of one-carbon units, which are crucial for various biochemical reactions in the body.",
        "Carbohydrate Metabolism": "PLP participates in carbohydrate metabolism, aiding in the breakdown and utilization of carbohydrates for energy.",
        "Lipid Metabolism": "PLP also contributes to lipid metabolism, assisting in the breakdown and utilization of fats.",
        "Cognitive Development": "Vitamin B6 supports cognitive development by facilitating the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, which are essential for brain function.",
        "Homocysteine Regulation": "Vitamin B6 helps maintain normal levels of homocysteine in the blood, which is important for cardiovascular health.",
        "Gluconeogenesis and Glycogenolysis": "Vitamin B6 is involved in gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) and glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into glucose), important processes for maintaining blood sugar levels.",
        "Immune Function": "Vitamin B6 promotes immune function by supporting lymphocyte and interleukin-2 production, key components of the immune response.",
        "Hemoglobin Formation": "Vitamin B6 is necessary for hemoglobin formation, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body."

    sources: {
        "Food": "Vitamin B6 is abundantly found in various food sources, with notable concentrations in fish, beef liver, potatoes, and certain fruits (excluding citrus). In the United States, adults primarily obtain their dietary vitamin B6 from fortified cereals, beef, poultry, starchy vegetables, and select non-citrus fruits. The bioavailability of vitamin B6 from a mixed diet is estimated to be around 75%.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A diverse array of foods contributes to dietary vitamin B6 intake, as indicated by the table showcasing selected food sources. Chickpeas, beef liver, tuna, salmon, chicken breast, fortified breakfast cereals, potatoes, turkey, bananas, marinara sauce, and various other foods contain varying amounts of vitamin B6 per serving, with percentages of the Daily Value (DV) provided.",
        "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin B6 is readily available in various forms of dietary supplements, including multivitamins, B complex formulations, and standalone supplements. Pyridoxine hydrochloride (HCl) is the most common form of vitamin B6 in supplements, although some may contain pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). These supplements are typically available in oral capsules, tablets (including sublingual and chewable), and liquid forms.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Absorption of vitamin B6 from supplements closely resembles that from food sources and does not significantly differ among different supplement forms. However, despite good absorption of large pharmacological doses, the body quickly eliminates most of the excess vitamin B6 through urine."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B6 varies depending on your age and gender. For example, infants typically need between 0.1 mg to 0.6 mg, while children aged 1 to 13 years require 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg. Teens need slightly more, with boys requiring 1.3 mg and girls needing 1.2 mg. Adults aged 19 to 50 years generally require 1.3 mg, while those over 51 years may need slightly more, with men requiring 1.7 mg and women needing 1.5 mg. Pregnant and breastfeeding women usually need higher amounts, around 1.9 mg to 2.0 mg.",
    deficiency: "Insufficient intake can lead to various symptoms. These include anemia, itchy rashes, scaly skin on the lips, cracks at the corners of the mouth, and a swollen tongue. Additionally, individuals with very low levels may experience depression, confusion, and weakened immune function. In infants, inadequate vitamin B6 intake can cause irritability, heightened sensitivity to sound, or seizures.",
