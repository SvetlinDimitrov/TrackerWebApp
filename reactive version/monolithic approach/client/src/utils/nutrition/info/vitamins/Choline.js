const choline = {
    description: "Choline is an essential nutrient found in various foods and is crucial for brain and nervous system functions, including memory, mood, and muscle control. It is also necessary for forming cell membranes. Although the liver produces a small amount of choline, the majority must be obtained through diet.",
    functions: {
        "Source of Methyl Groups for Metabolism": "Choline serves as a source of methyl groups crucial for various metabolic processes.",
        "Synthesis of Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin": "Choline is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, two major phospholipids vital for maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes.",
        "Production of Acetylcholine": "Choline is necessary for the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for memory, mood regulation, muscle control, and other brain and nervous system functions.",
        "Modulation of Gene Expression": "Choline plays a role in modulating gene expression, impacting various cellular processes.",
        "Cell Membrane Signaling": "Choline is involved in cell membrane signaling, which is crucial for intercellular communication and cellular function regulation.",
        "Lipid Transport and Metabolism": "Choline plays a role in lipid transport and metabolism, contributing to the regulation of lipid levels in the body.",
        "Contribution to Early Brain Development": "Choline is essential for early brain development, contributing to proper brain structure and function during fetal and infant stages.",
        "Regulation by Estrogen": "The need for dietary choline may vary based on estrogen levels, as estrogen induces the gene responsible for choline biosynthesis.",
        "Interaction with Folate": "Choline needs may increase when folate levels are deficient, as choline becomes the primary methyl donor in the absence of sufficient folate."

    sources: {
        "Food": "animal-based products like meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs being particularly rich in this nutrient. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables, certain beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains also contribute to choline intake. Phosphatidylcholine, found in foods like beef liver and eggs, makes up a significant portion of dietary choline. Lecithin, a substance rich in phosphatidylcholine, is commonly added to processed foods as an emulsifying agent. Choline is naturally present in breast milk and is added to most commercial infant formulas. While precise absorption rates of different forms of choline are not fully understood, various foods contain differing amounts of choline, with beef liver and eggs being particularly high in choline content.",
        "Dietary supplements": "Choline is available in various forms, including choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine, and lecithin. These supplements may contain choline alone or in combination with other B-complex vitamins or as part of multivitamin/mineral products. Typical choline amounts in supplements range from 10 mg to 250 mg. However, there are no studies comparing the relative bioavailability of choline from different supplement forms."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of choline varies depending on age and gender. For infants, it ranges from 125 mg to 150 mg during the first year of life, increasing gradually as they grow older. Children aged 1-3 years need around 200 mg, while those aged 4-8 years require 250 mg. Adolescents aged 9-13 years should aim for 375 mg daily. Teenage boys need the most at 550 mg, while teenage girls require 400 mg. For adults, men should aim for 550 mg per day, whereas women need slightly less at 425 mg. Pregnant and breastfeeding teens and women have slightly higher requirements, with recommendations set at 450 mg and 550 mg respectively.",
    deficiency: "Symptoms of choline deficiency are rare due to the body's ability to synthesize some choline. However, if choline levels become critically low, individuals may experience muscle and liver damage, along with the accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to liver damage.",
