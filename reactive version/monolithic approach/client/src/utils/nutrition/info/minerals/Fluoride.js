    description: "Fluoride is a mineral with two primary functions: preventing tooth decay and promoting bone strength. It plays a crucial role in dental health by protecting against cavities and maintaining strong teeth. Additionally, fluoride contributes to bone health by ensuring their strength and integrity.",
    functions: {
        "Dental Caries Prevention": "Fluoride inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay, contributing to overall dental health.",
        "Bone Health Promotion": "Fluoride stimulates new bone formation, playing a role in maintaining bone strength and integrity."

    sources: {
        "Food": "Brewed tea, depending on its type, can contain higher levels of fluoride, ranging from 0.07 to 1.5 mg per cup. Breast milk and cow's milk have very low fluoride concentrations, as do most foods not prepared with fluoridated water. Infant formulas have varying fluoride levels, with milk-based formulas containing less than 0.2 mg/L and soy-based ones ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L. Generally, foods provide trace amounts of fluoride, with most offering less than 0.05 mg per 100 g serving.",
        "Fluoridated Drinking Water": "Municipal drinking water contains fluoride to prevent dental caries, with recommended concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L. About 60% of fluoride intake in the U.S. comes from fluoridated community water systems. Fluoride levels in tap water vary by county and can be checked through the CDC's website. Private water sources may have different fluoride concentrations.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Some dietary supplements contain fluoride, primarily as sodium fluoride, with typical amounts ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg.",
        "Dental Products": "Most toothpaste contains fluoride, typically at levels of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L. Fluoride is also present in mouth rinses, topical treatments, and dental devices like orthodontic bracket adhesives and sealants.",
        "Medications": "Certain medications, such as voriconazole, contain fluoride, with typical doses providing 65 mg/day. Long-term use can lead to high fluoride concentrations in serum, potentially causing skeletal fluorosis and periostitis."

    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of fluoride varies based on age and gender. For infants, it starts at 0.01 mg from birth to 6 months and increases to 0.5 mg between 7 to 12 months. Children aged 1 to 8 years require 0.7 mg to 1 mg daily, while those aged 9 to 13 years need 2 mg. Adolescents aged 14 to 18 years, along with adult men and pregnant or breastfeeding women, require 3 mg daily. For non-pregnant adult women, the recommended intake is 3 mg, while it's 4 mg for adult men.",
