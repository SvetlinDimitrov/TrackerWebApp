    description: "Calcium is an essential mineral that is crucial for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. It is the most abundant mineral in the body, with nearly all of it stored in bones and teeth, providing them with structure and hardness. Calcium is also vital for muscle movement, nerve function, blood circulation, and hormone release. Additionally, vitamin D is important because it helps the body absorb calcium.",
    functions: {
        "Bone and Teeth Structure": "Calcium makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth and allows normal bodily movement by keeping tissue rigid, strong, and flexible.",
        "Blood Vessel Function": "The small ionized pool of calcium mediates blood vessel contraction and dilation.",
        "Muscle Function": "Calcium mediates muscle function.",
        "Blood Clotting": "Calcium mediates blood clotting.",
        "Nerve Transmission": "Calcium mediates nerve transmission.",
        "Hormonal Secretion": "Calcium mediates hormonal secretion.",
        "Calcium Absorption": "Calcium from foods and dietary supplements is absorbed by both active transport and passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa. Active transport is responsible for most absorption when calcium intakes are lower, and passive diffusion accounts for an increasing proportion of calcium absorption as intakes rise.",
        "Bone Remodeling": "Bone undergoes continuous remodeling with constant resorption and deposition of calcium into new bone, which is required to change bone size during growth, repair damage, maintain serum calcium levels, and provide a source of other minerals.",
        "Calcium Homeostasis": "The body uses bones as a reservoir for, and source of, calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis.",
    },
    sources: {
        "Food": "Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese contribute significantly to calcium intake, with about 72% of calcium intake in the US coming from these sources. Other sources include canned sardines and salmon with bones, as well as certain vegetables like kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage. Fortified foods such as fruit juices, tofu, and cereals also provide calcium. Calcium absorption varies depending on the type of food, with dairy products and fortified foods having higher absorption rates compared to certain plants which contain compounds that decrease absorption.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Calcium is available in various dietary supplements, including multivitamin/mineral products and supplements containing calcium only or calcium plus vitamin D. Common forms include calcium carbonate and calcium citrate, each with varying absorption rates and elemental calcium content. Absorption from supplements depends on the total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time, with higher doses resulting in lower absorption rates. Some individuals may experience gastrointestinal side effects with calcium supplements, which can be managed by adjusting the form of calcium or the dosage regimen.",
        "Medicines": "Calcium carbonate is present in some over-the-counter antacid products due to its ability to neutralize stomach acid. Each chewable pill or soft chew typically provides around 270 to 400 mg of calcium."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The amount of calcium you need each day varies by age and sex. Infants up to 6 months need 200 mg, and those 7–12 months require 260 mg. Children aged 1–3 years should get 700 mg, while those 4–8 years need 1,000 mg. For children and teens aged 9–18 years, the recommended amount is 1,300 mg. Adults aged 19–50 need 1,000 mg, but women aged 51–70 should increase their intake to 1,200 mg, while men in this age group continue to need 1,000 mg. All adults over 71 years should consume 1,200 mg. Pregnant and breastfeeding teens require 1,300 mg, whereas pregnant and breastfeeding adults need 1,000 mg.",
    deficiency: "Not getting enough calcium can lead to several health issues. It can cause osteoporosis, which results in weak and fragile bones, increasing the risk of falls and fractures. In children, a calcium deficiency can lead to rickets, a condition that causes soft and weak bones. Additionally, both children and adults can develop osteomalacia, which also results in soft bones.",
