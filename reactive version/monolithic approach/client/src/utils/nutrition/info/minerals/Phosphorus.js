    description:"Phosphorus is a mineral essential to the functioning of every cell in the human body. While a significant portion is found in bones and teeth, some is also present in genetic material. Phosphorus plays crucial roles in energy production and facilitates numerous vital chemical processes within the body.",
    functions: {
        "Component of biological structures" :"Phosphorus is a vital component of bones, teeth, DNA, RNA, phospholipids in cell membranes, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's primary energy source.",
        "Cell Membrane Structure and Energy Source" : "As phospholipids, phosphorus contributes to the structure of cell membranes and acts as a vital component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for cellular activities.",
        "Interplay with calcium" : "Phosphorus and calcium metabolism are closely linked, regulated by hormones like vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH). They both contribute to the formation of hydroxyapatite, the main structural component in bones and tooth enamel.",
        "Role in Protein and Sugar Functionality": "Phosphorus plays a crucial role in the functionality of many proteins and sugars in the body, particularly through phosphorylation processes.",
        "Regulation of Gene Transcription and Enzyme Activation" : "Phosphorus is involved in the regulation of gene transcription, activation of enzymes, and maintenance of normal pH levels in extracellular fluid.",
        "Intracellular Energy Storage" : "It contributes to intracellular energy storage mechanisms, aiding in the storage and release of energy as needed by cells."

    sources: {
        "Food": "Phosphorus is naturally present in a wide range of foods, including dairy products, meats, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, vegetables, and grains. Dairy products and bakery items contribute significantly to phosphorus intake in the United States. The absorption rate of phosphorus from food ranges from 40% to 70%, with animal sources being more readily absorbed than plant sources. Phosphorus absorption can be affected by calcium intake, which can bind to phosphorus and reduce its absorption. Additionally, phosphate additives in processed foods can significantly contribute to overall phosphorus intake.",
        "Supplements" : "Dietary supplements containing phosphorus are available in various forms, including phosphate salts and phospholipids. These supplements may be standalone phosphorus products or combined with other ingredients. While most supplements provide 10% or less of the Daily Value (DV) for phosphorus, some may deliver higher concentrations. The bioavailability of phosphate salts in supplements is approximately 70%, although the bioavailability of other phosphorus forms has not been extensively studied in humans."

    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of phosphorus varies depending on age and life stage. Infants require 100 mg from birth to 6 months, increasing to 275 mg between 7 to 12 months. For children aged 1 to 8 years, the recommended amount ranges from 460 mg to 500 mg. Adolescents aged 9 to 18 years, including pregnant and breastfeeding teens, should aim for 1,250 mg daily. Adults aged 19 years and older, along with pregnant and breastfeeding women, require 700 mg of phosphorus per day.",
    deficiency: "Can lead to various symptoms including loss of appetite, anemia, muscle weakness, coordination issues, bone pain, deformities in bone structure, increased susceptibility to infections, sensations of burning or prickling in the skin, and confusion.",
