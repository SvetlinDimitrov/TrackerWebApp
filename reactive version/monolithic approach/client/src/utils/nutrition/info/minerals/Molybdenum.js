    description: "Molybdenum, a vital mineral, is essential for maintaining overall health. The body relies on molybdenum for crucial functions such as protein processing and DNA synthesis. Additionally, molybdenum aids in the breakdown of drugs and harmful substances that may enter the body, contributing to detoxification processes.",
    functions: {
        "Absorption and Metabolism": "Molybdenum is absorbed passively through a nonmediated process in the gastrointestinal tract, with absorption rates varying from 40% to 100% in adults and nearly complete absorption in infants from breast milk or formula. The kidneys primarily regulate molybdenum levels in the body, where it is excreted, while molybdenum in the form of molybdopterin is stored in the liver, kidney, adrenal glands, and bone.",
        "Enzyme Function": "Molybdenum serves as a structural component of molybdopterin, a cofactor crucial for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes play pivotal roles in metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids, heterocyclic compounds like purines and pyrimidines, and are also involved in the metabolism of drugs and toxins."
    },
    sources: {
        "Food": "Molybdenum-rich foods include legumes, whole grains, nuts, and beef liver. Legumes, such as black-eyed peas and lima beans, stand out as top sources. Other significant contributors to molybdenum intake in the U.S. diet include cereal grains, leafy vegetables, beef liver, and dairy products like milk and cheese. The molybdenum content in food depends on soil and water molybdenum levels, with drinking water generally containing minimal amounts. However, a small percentage of drinking water samples may exceed certain molybdenum thresholds.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Molybdenum is available in dietary supplements either as a standalone supplement, combined with other minerals, or as part of multivitamin/mineral products. Supplemental forms range from approximately 50 mcg to 500 mcg and include molybdenum chloride, sodium molybdate, molybdenum glycinate, and molybdenum amino acid chelate. However, no studies have compared the bioavailability of molybdenum from these different forms."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of molybdenum varies based on age. Infants require minimal amounts, with levels increasing as they grow. Children aged 1 to 13 years need progressively higher doses, with teenagers requiring slightly more. For adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the recommended daily amount remains relatively consistent at 45 to 50 micrograms.",
    deficiency: "Occurs only in individuals with an extremely uncommon genetic condition known as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. This disorder inhibits the body's ability to utilize molybdenum, resulting in serious consequences such as seizures and severe brain damage, often leading to death shortly after birth.",
