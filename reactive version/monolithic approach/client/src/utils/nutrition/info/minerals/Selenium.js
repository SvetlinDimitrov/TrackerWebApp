    description: "Selenium is an essential nutrient crucial for maintaining overall health. It plays key roles in various bodily functions, including reproduction, thyroid gland function, DNA production, and immune system support. Additionally, selenium acts as an antioxidant, protecting the body from damage caused by harmful free radicals and helping to combat infections.",
    functions: {
        "Thyroid Hormone Metabolism": "Selenium plays a crucial role in thyroid hormone metabolism, facilitating the synthesis and activation of thyroid hormones essential for regulating metabolism and various physiological processes.",
        "DNA Synthesis": "Selenium contributes to DNA synthesis, aiding in the replication and repair of DNA, which is fundamental for cell growth, development, and overall health.",
        "Reproduction": "Selenium is involved in reproductive processes, influencing fertility and reproductive health in both males and females.",
        "Protection from Oxidative Damage": "Selenium acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. This function helps prevent cellular damage and supports overall health.",
        "Immune Function": "Selenium plays a role in immune response, supporting the body's defense mechanisms against infections and diseases.",
        "Skeletal Muscle Function": "Approximately 28% to 46% of the total body's selenium content is found in skeletal muscle, indicating its importance in maintaining muscle function and overall muscular health."

    sources: {
        "Food": "Selenium is primarily found in protein-rich foods such as Brazil nuts, seafood, meat, poultry, and organ meats. Other sources include cereals, grains, and dairy products. The selenium content in plant-based foods varies depending on the selenium content of the soil and other factors, resulting in varying concentrations by geographic location. For example, Brazil nuts have the highest selenium content per ounce, while other foods like tuna, sardines, pork, and beef also contribute significant amounts of selenium to the diet.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Selenium supplements are available in various forms, including selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast, sodium selenite, and sodium selenate. These supplements are commonly included in multivitamin/mineral supplements, often containing doses of 55 mcg. Selenium-only supplements may contain higher doses ranging from 100 to 400 mcg. The body absorbs selenium efficiently from these supplements, with selenomethionine and selenium-enriched yeast being particularly well-absorbed."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of selenium varies depending on age and life stage. Infants require 15-20 mcg during the first year, while children aged 1-13 years need 20-40 mcg. For teenagers aged 14-18, the recommended amount is 55 mcg, and for adults aged 19-70, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, it remains at 55 mcg. Adults aged 71 and older have the same recommended intake. Pregnant teens and women should aim for 60 mcg, while breastfeeding teens and women require slightly more at 70 mcg per day.",
    deficiency: "Selenium deficiency is uncommon, with notable health implications. Insufficient selenium intake can lead to conditions like Keshan disease, which affects the heart, and male infertility. Additionally, there's a potential link to Kashin-Beck disease, a form of arthritis characterized by joint pain, swelling, and limited mobility.",
