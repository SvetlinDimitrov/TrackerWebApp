    description: "Manganese is an essential mineral crucial for maintaining overall health. It plays a vital role in energy production and cell protection, contributing to strong bones, reproductive health, blood clotting, and a robust immune system.",
    functions: {
        "Absorption and Transport": "Manganese is absorbed in the small intestine via an active transport system, with some potential diffusion at high intakes. Once absorbed, it remains free or binds to proteins like transferrin and albumin for transport to various tissues, including the liver, pancreas, kidney, and brain.",
        "Metabolic Cofactor": "Manganese serves as a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in essential metabolic processes such as amino acid, cholesterol, glucose, and carbohydrate metabolism. It also plays a role in reactive oxygen species scavenging, bone formation, reproduction, and immune response.",
        "Hemostasis": "Alongside vitamin K, manganese contributes to blood clotting and hemostasis, ensuring proper coagulation processes in the body.",
    },
    sources: {
        "Food": "Manganese is found in a diverse range of foods, including whole grains, shellfish, nuts, legumes, rice, leafy vegetables, coffee, tea, and spices like black pepper. Drinking water also contains trace amounts of manganese. Key dietary sources include mussels, hazelnuts, pecans, brown rice, oysters, and chickpeas. Infants absorb higher proportions of manganese than adults, with breast milk showing higher absorption rates compared to formula milk.",
        "Dietary supplements": "Dietary supplements offer various forms of manganese, such as amino acid chelates, gluconate, picolinate, sulfate, citrate, and chloride. Multivitamin/mineral supplements may contain 1.0 to 4.5 mg of manganese, while supplements with manganese alone or in combination with other nutrients typically provide 5 to 20 mg. The amount of elemental manganese is declared on the Supplement Facts label, facilitating dosage control."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of manganese varies based on age and gender. Infants need minimal amounts, starting from 0.003 mg for newborns up to 0.6 mg for infants aged 7-12 months. For children aged 1-8 years, the recommended intake ranges from 1.2 mg to 1.5 mg. During adolescence, boys require slightly more manganese than girls, with recommendations ranging from 1.6 mg to 2.2 mg. Adult men are advised to consume 2.3 mg daily, while adult women need slightly less at 1.8 mg. Pregnant and breastfeeding teens and women have higher requirements, with recommended intakes of 2.0 mg and 2.6 mg, respectively.",
    deficiency: "Can lead to several symptoms. In children, inadequate manganese intake may result in weakened bones and stunted growth. Men may experience skin rashes and loss of hair color due to manganese deficiency. Women might notice mood changes and increased premenstrual pain when they lack sufficient manganese in their diet.",
