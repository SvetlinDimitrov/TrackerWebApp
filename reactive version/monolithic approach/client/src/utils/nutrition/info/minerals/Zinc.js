    dailyIntake: "The daily zinc requirement varies by age. For infants, 2 mg is needed from birth to 6 months, and 3 mg from 7 to 12 months. Children aged 1 to 3 years need 3 mg, those 4 to 8 years require 5 mg, and 9 to 13 years need 8 mg. Teen males aged 14 to 18 need 11 mg, while teen females require 9 mg. Adult males need 11 mg, and adult females need 8 mg. Pregnant teens require 12 mg, and pregnant adults need 11 mg. Breastfeeding teens require 13 mg, while breastfeeding adults need 12 mg of zinc daily.",
    deficiency: "Zinc deficiency can cause various health issues across different age groups. In infants and children, it can lead to diarrhea, slow growth, loss of appetite, hair loss, and frequent infections, as well as potential reproductive problems in adulthood. At any age, zinc deficiency can cause loss of taste and smell. In older adults, it can delay wound healing and cause cognitive problems. During pregnancy, especially in lower-income countries, zinc deficiency can lead to premature births, low birth weight, and higher infant mortality. Many of these symptoms can also indicate other health issues, so it is important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.",
