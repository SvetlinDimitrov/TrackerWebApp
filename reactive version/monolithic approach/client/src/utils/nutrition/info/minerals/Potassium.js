    description: "Potassium is a crucial mineral abundant in various foods. It plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, essential for proper kidney and heart operation, muscle contraction, and nerve signal transmission.",
    functions: {
        "Maintaining Intracellular Fluid Volume": "Potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining the volume of fluid inside cells, essential for normal cell function.",
        "Transmembrane Electrochemical Gradients": "Potassium helps establish and maintain transmembrane electrochemical gradients, vital for nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and kidney function.",
        "Sodium-Potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase Transporter": "The sodium-potassium ATPase transporter maintains the balance of potassium and sodium ions across cell membranes, crucial for cellular tonicity and proper physiological functions.",
    },
    sources: {
        "Food": "Potassium is abundant in various plant and animal foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, potatoes, meats, poultry, fish, milk, yogurt, and nuts. Starchy foods like whole-wheat flour and brown rice are notably rich in potassium compared to their refined counterparts. The body absorbs around 85%â€“90% of dietary potassium, contributing significantly to overall intake.",
        "Top Sources in the Diet": "Milk, coffee, tea, other nonalcoholic beverages, and potatoes are among the primary dietary sources of potassium for adults in the United States. For children, milk, fruit juice, potatoes, and fruit rank highest. Fruits like apricots and prunes, lentils, squash, and potatoes are particularly rich sources of potassium.",
        "Dietary Supplements": "Potassium supplements are commonly available in various forms, including potassium chloride, citrate, phosphate, aspartate, bicarbonate, and gluconate. While potassium chloride is the predominant form, other formulations are also utilized. Multivitamin/mineral supplements may contain potassium, typically around 80 mg, while potassium-only supplements may provide up to 99 mg. Manufacturers often limit potassium content to 99 mg due to safety concerns related to higher doses.",
        "Salt Substitutes": "Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride as a replacement for sodium chloride. The potassium content in these products varies widely, presenting potential risks, particularly for individuals with kidney disease or those taking specific medications. Consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended before using salt substitutes due to the risk of hyperkalemia associated with high potassium levels."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of potassium varies depending on age and gender. For instance, infants aged birth to 6 months are advised to consume 400 mg of potassium daily, while adults aged 19 years and older should aim for 3,400 mg (for men) and 2,600 mg (for women). Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals also have specific potassium intake recommendations, such as 2,900 mg for pregnant women and 2,800 mg for breastfeeding women.",
    deficiency: "When potassium intake is insufficient, it can lead to various health issues. Low potassium levels may elevate blood pressure, reduce bone calcium, and heighten the risk of kidney stones. Severe potassium deficiency, known as hypokalemia, can result from factors like prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, diuretic use, or certain medications. Symptoms of hypokalemia range from constipation and fatigue to muscle weakness and irregular heartbeat. In severe cases, it can cause muscle paralysis, breathing difficulties, and even be life-threatening.",
