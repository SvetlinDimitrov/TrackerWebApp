    description: "Copper is an essential mineral crucial for maintaining overall health. It plays a vital role in various bodily functions, such as energy production, the formation of connective tissues and blood vessels, and the maintenance of the nervous and immune systems. Additionally, copper is involved in activating genes and is necessary for proper brain development.",
    functions: {
        "Energy production": "Copper serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production, supporting metabolic processes essential for cellular function and vitality.",
        "Iron metabolism": "Copper plays a crucial role in iron metabolism, facilitating the absorption, transport, and utilization of iron in the body. This ensures proper oxygen transport and utilization.",
        "Neuropeptide activation": "As a cofactor for certain enzymes, copper is involved in the activation of neuropeptides, which play key roles in neurotransmission and neuronal signaling.",
        "Connective tissue synthesis": "Copper is essential for the synthesis of connective tissues such as collagen and elastin, which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and organs throughout the body.",
        "Neurotransmitter synthesis": "Copper contributes to the synthesis of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers involved in communication between nerve cells, thereby supporting proper nervous system function.",
        "Angiogenesis": "Copper is involved in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, which is crucial for tissue growth, wound healing, and overall vascular health.",
        "Regulation of gene expression": "Copper plays a role in regulating gene expression, influencing various physiological processes such as brain development, pigmentation, and immune system functioning.",
        "Defense against oxidative damage": "Copper-containing enzymes like superoxide dismutases act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. This helps maintain cellular integrity and overall health."

    sources: {
        "Food": "Food sources of copper include shellfish, seeds and nuts, organ meats, whole-grain products, and chocolate, providing varying amounts of this essential mineral. The bioavailability of copper from the diet depends on its amount, ranging from 75% when intake is low to 12% when intake is high. Additionally, tap water and beverages can contribute to copper intake, with varying levels depending on the water source.",
        "Dietary supplements": "Dietary supplements containing copper are available in various forms, including cupric oxide, cupric sulfate, and copper amino acid chelates, often found in multivitamin/mineral products. These supplements typically provide a range of copper doses, from a few micrograms to 15 mg, significantly exceeding the daily recommended intake for adults and children."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The daily recommended intake of copper varies depending on age. Infants from birth to 6 months should aim for 200 mcg, while those aged 7-12 months need slightly more at 220 mcg. Children aged 1-3 years should consume 340 mcg, and those aged 4-8 years should aim for 440 mcg. For children aged 9-13 years, the recommended intake increases to 700 mcg. Teens aged 14-18 years require 890 mcg daily, while adults aged 19 years and older should aim for 900 mcg. Pregnant teens and women have higher requirements at 1,000 mcg, and breastfeeding teens and women should aim for 1,300 mcg of copper daily.",
    deficiency: "Can lead to various health issues. Symptoms may include severe fatigue, changes in skin pigmentation, elevated cholesterol levels, and disorders affecting connective tissues like ligaments and skin. Additionally, copper deficiency can result in weakened bones, impaired balance and coordination, and heightened susceptibility to infections.",
